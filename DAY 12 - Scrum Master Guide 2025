🔥 Day 12
🚫 What’s the one question every Scrum Master should ask their team daily?
💎 It’s simpler than you think—but changes everything.

Scrum Masters play a pivotal role in fostering collaboration and removing blockers, but sometimes, we overcomplicate things. The key to empowering your team isn’t about micromanaging or solving every problem yourself. Instead, it’s about creating space for the team to own their process and outcomes.

And the right question can unlock this ownership.

🔑 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀
📍 The Question: “What can we improve today?” This simple yet powerful question shifts the focus from routine updates to continuous improvement. It encourages the team to think proactively about challenges and solutions.
📍 Why It Matters Asking this question daily reinforces an Agile mindset. It reminds the team that improvement isn’t a one-time event during retrospectives—it’s a daily commitment.
📍 Fostering Team Ownership When the team identifies areas for improvement, they’re more likely to take ownership of solutions. This leads to stronger engagement and better results over time.

✅ 𝗘𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
According to the 15th State of Agile Report, teams that prioritize continuous improvement see a 30% increase in velocity and are 40% more likely to achieve sprint goals consistently. This question turns improvement into a habit rather than an afterthought.

🎯 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻
The right question can transform how your team works. By asking, “What can we improve today?” you encourage a culture of reflection, adaptability, and ownership.
